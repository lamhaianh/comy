Comy is a simple URL Shortener service that uses Scala, Netty, and MongoDB.
URLs will be shorten to a 7-character string using base 62. In theory, it can
support up to 62^7 unique URLs (more than 3 trillions).

See:
* INSTALL for installation
* DEVELOPMENT if you are a developer

== Usage

To shorten a URL, send a POST request to:
http://SERVER/api?url=URL

Response:
* Response code = 200: the response body is a key to lookup the original URL later
* Response code = 500: there is something wrong at the server side, for example
  the DB may be down

To be redirected to the original long URL, send a GET request to:
http://SERVER/KEY

Response:
* Response code = 301: the client will be redirected to the original URL
* Response code = 404: invalid key or the key has been expired
* Response code = 500: there is something wrong at the server side, for example
  the DB may be down
